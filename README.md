## StormingRobots

Everything that is here is from what Ms. Mabrey taught me (in C). I learned the basics of computational thinking along with C. I started during the start of the school year in 2019 and have been continuing ever since. The book used is C programing A modern approach second edition by king.

Also check out [USACO-Group.md](https://github.com/asubramanian08/StormingRobots/blob/master/USACO-Group.md) for how I lead a discussion on [USACO](http://usaco.org/) Bronze and Silver problems. In April 2022, I hosted the USACO director, Dr. Brian Dean, in a Q&A facilitated by [Storming Robots](https://stormingrobots.com/prod/default.html) and the [USACO-Group.md](https://github.com/asubramanian08/StormingRobots/blob/master/USACO-Group.md)! Read more about it using this[https://github.com/asubramanian08/StormingRobots/blob/master/USACO-Group.md#hosting-dr-dean] link.

### Format
Each folder is divided by weeks, so there are some folders that are continuations of the previous week's topic.

### Resources
[Here](https://stormingrobots.com/prod/default.html) is the link to the storming robots main page.

[Here](https://www.stormingrobots.com/prod/pdf/csSyllabus.pdf) is the curriculum. Note that the part 5 of the syllabus is in my [C_plus_plus repository](https://github.com/asubramanian08/C-plus-plus)

(Although it often changes) The questions and exercises are on the [CS modules](https://www.stormingrobots.com/prod/tutorial/index.html#csModules).

### [C++ class](https://github.com/asubramanian08/C-plus-plus)

This class is taught by Mr. Mabrey where I learned things like classes, STL, and Iterations. [The book](https://github.com/asubramanian08/C-plus-plus/blob/master/C%2B%2B%20Primer%20Plus.pdf) he teaches off of is in that repository. Look at the [C++ Read Me](https://github.com/asubramanian08/C-plus-plus/blob/master/README.md) for more information about that class.
