## USACO-Group

### About
Starting 10/15/21 I formed a [USACO](http://usaco.org/) group in [Storming Robots](https://stormingrobots.com/prod/default.html). We meet every friday 4:30 to 6:00 pm est. Anyone interested in [joining](https://stormingrobots.com/prod/usaco.html) should contact office@stormingrobots.com and must have a reasonable C/C++ ability (knowing recursion and simple DP). Each week I volunteer my time to discuss [USACO](http://usaco.org/) Bronze or Silver problems in order to strengthen algorithmic thinking skills and hopefully pass [USACO](http://usaco.org/) Bronze. [This](https://stormingrobots.com/prod/usaco.html) is the website for the [USACO Student Circle](https://stormingrobots.com/prod/usaco.html). I had a great experience leading the discussion and trying to get people to form solutions by developing their algorithmic thinking skills.
